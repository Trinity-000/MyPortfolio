<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr />
    <p>My story starts with Hibiscus.</p>
    <p>For over 20 years of my life, I struggled with severe dermatological conditions including excessive dandruff. It got to a point where my self esteem took a severe hit. I tried every face wash, shampoo, keto soap, lotion and serum on the market. Just so I could step out in public with confidence. Nothing ever worked until a local herbalist asked me to replace my shampoos and soaps with ground hibiscus leaf paste and green gram flour. A deceptively simple solution, in which I initially had 0 faith.</p>  
    <p>I'd already spent so much money on "products" that I was skeptical that the hibiscus plant in my backyard would cure me, FOR FREE. Long story short, within two months of me using "thaali" (paste of hibiscus leaves), my skin and scalp completely cleared up.</p>
    <p>Six years later, I’m thriving on a product-free lifestyle, finding joy in brewing my own shampoos, oils, kohl, and bathing powders.</p>
    <p>My name is Aiswarya. A writer, polyglot, content marketer, amateur developer and part time herbalist.</p>    
    <p>This particular experience, despite being quite trivial, had a butterfly effect on all other areas of my life. It inspired me to question consumerist norms and explore alternatives rooted in ancestral wisdom. I guess I owe my entire worldview and life philosophy to a single plant, Hibiscus.</p>
